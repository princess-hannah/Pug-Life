      <p>Pugs are one of three types of short-nosed dogs who were known to be bred as a royal companion. They originated in the Far East and can be traced back to the first century B.C. They were considered a royal dog in China, 
        owned by aristocrats and bestowed as precious gifts – rather than sold – to rulers in foreign countries. Pugs have a very rich and amazing history that can be traced way back to 700 BC at the time of Confucius when they were known as lo-sze. The breed is considered one of the oldest canine breeds today. There are many theories as to the Pug’s origin—one theory states that the breed is a descendant of the short-haired Pekingese; another theory postulates that the Pug is a cross of a small Bulldog; and, a third theory speculates it is a miniature form of the French Mastiff (Dogue de Bordeaux).</p>
