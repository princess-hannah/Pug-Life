      <p>This is a picture of Oscar, the pug in the box </p>
      <p>It was the coldest night of the year in February 2013 — just a couple of nights before the Academy Awards — and the temperature had dipped below freezing in Lancaster, Calif., just north of Los Angeles. A man in a suit walked into the animal shelter, placed a small cardboard box on the counter and said, “I’m turning this dog in because he’s old and can’t walk anymore.” The man turned away without further explanation and walked out the door, as his pug’s sad, gray, little face peered out from the box. The poor dog was a mess — paralyzed back legs, sores on his hindquarters from sitting in his own urine and feces, infested with fleas, raging bladder infection, ear mites, and more health problems than one dog should ever have to suffer. It was apparent that his owner had let the dog’s health deteriorate for months — probably years — and done nothing to get medical attention for his canine. But it wasn’t this dog’s night to die — not that evening. A kind soul at the shelter alerted Lori Zech-Shaw at Pug Nation Rescue of Los Angeles, who promptly dispatched one of their rescuers to get him out of there. The rescuer took the dog straight to their vet, who issued a cautious prognosis. It wasn’t at all clear whether this pug could be saved or not. His skin was so ulcerated with urine burns and flea infestations, it was uncertain if his sores could heal. His urinary infection was so bad that they might have to amputate his little penis. The dog had been neglected for a very long time, and now, at 13 years of age, it wasn’t at all clear whether the paraplegic pug could recover — and if he did, what his quality of life would be. Lori Zech-Shaw posted the dog’s photo and his rescue story on Pug Nation L.A.’s Facebook page. “Oscar, the Senior Pug in a Box” they called him. Oscar, named for the night he was rescued.</p>

    <p>This is a picture of Shelby, who is in America </p>
     <p>Shweet Shelby! Available for Adoption or long-term foster placement As his namesake suggests, Shelby is a as sweet as Southern Iced Tea! This 5 year old gentleman Pug is full of nothing but joy and happiness. He is truly one of the happiest Pugs we have ever encountered! He gleefully wags his tail when meeting new dogs and very much wants to play. He loves to play with stuffed toys and is a very gentle boy. Whenever his foster Mom bends down to rub his broad chest, he offers her a sweet kiss on the nose. Several months prior to being surrendered to TBIN, Shelby jumped off of a sofa and injured his back. Some anti-inflammatories were given and he recovered quickly but has a sway and swagger to his gait - we think it just makes him even more endearing. This does not slow him down as he walks and even runs. The injury did leave him with less control over his bowels and bladder - this is managed by a belly band and a good sense of humor. Shelby can urinate on his own but, his foster Mom expresses his bladder (this is VERY easy to do) in order to ensure that he is completely empty. Shelby does poop when he is sleeping - adopters should be prepared to deal with this (again, this is easy to manage but, it is not for everyone so, please be honest with yourself (and us!) prior to inquiring about him). Shelby eats a very high quality diet so he only poops once a day. While this may sound unappealing to some, we promise it is not a big deal and this sweet boy is more than worth it. Shelby is in no pain and his condition does not require any medications. When Shelby was surrendered, he was dangerously obese. Thankfully, with diet and exercise, the weight has come off and Shelby is feeling like a brand new Pug! He's now at his ideal weight and weighs around 22 pounds. He was raised around children and we feel he would be okay with older, respectful kiddos (7 and up). Shelby likes hanging out in a bed with another Pug or two so a home with a gentle, similarly sized dog would be nice but, we think he would be okay as an 'only', provided there was a human who was home at least part-time (he probably would not be happy being left all day). While shelby can go up a set of stairs if hands are placed on him to steady him, he should ideally be carried so, a home with fewer stairs or an adopter who doesn't mind carrying him would be best. A fenced yard is preferred but not a requirement. He is a fabulous little Pug and we know that whomever is fortunate enough to share their life with him will be rewarded with tons of Pug kisses and love. Shelby is neutered, up-to-date on vaccines, Heartworm negative, has been dewormed, has had a full senior profile (blood work and urinalysis), and is microchipped. If you feel that you have room in your heart and home for Shelby, please complete an Adoption Application.</p>

    <p>This is a picture of Gaby</p>
    <p>Gracious Gabby! Available for Adoption or long-term foster placement Gabby is an extremely sweet 9 year old female Pug. Gabby is the kind of gal who is happy to spend her days laying quietly at your feet on next to you on the couch. She asks for so little. Some yummy food, a kiss on the forehead, and a belly rub here and there. Her house manners are excellent and she gets along fabulously with dogs of all ages and sizes. Gabby is a bigger Pug who weighs around 25 pounds. Her soft brown eyes cary a beautiful, soulful expression and her quiet personality is nothing short of soothing. She is a precious gift wrapped up in a beautiful package of creamy fawn fur. TBIN was asked to help this little girl when her current guardian could not offer her the care she so desperately needed. When we learned that Gabby had been diagnosed with Diabetes a few weeks prior to them contacting us and had not been receiving any insulin, we knew she needed immediate veterinary attention. Untreated Diabetes is fatal and we knew that Gabby would need a great deal of TLC. Sadly, because Gabby had hyperglycemia (her blood glucose was in the 600-750+ range) she developed ketoacidosis which is a very serious complication of Diabetes. Thankfully, we caught it in time and after spending a day at the vet hospital, being started on insulin, and receiving tons of love and care, Gabby is now right as rain! Gabby will need insulin injections twice daily for the rest of her life, however, this is not difficult to do and she does not mind the injections at all (the needle is tiny). As is the case with 75% of all dogs diagnosed with Diabetes, Gabby has lost some of her vision, however, compensates and does extremely well. Gabby has bonded to her foster Mom and shows some signs of mild separation anxiety so a home where she is not left for long periods would be best. She would do well with another dog but, if someone is home and able to give her lots of attention, we think she would be fine as an 'only child', as well. Gabby is extremely gentle but given her size, we feel a home without young kids would be probably be best (8 and up). A fenced yard is a must. Please familiarize yourself with the breed. Pugs snort, snore, cannot tolerate the heat, and long to be with their people. If you feel that you have room in your heart and home for Gabby, please complete an Adoption Application.</p>
