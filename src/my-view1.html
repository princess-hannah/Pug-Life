      <p>This is a funny picture of a pug with doughnuts on it's chest.
      <p>You might be wondering if your Pug is pregnant and perhaps you can not get an appointment with the vet immediately. 
        A dog's pregnancy is a fast one compared to humans; therefore a dog will show signs of being pregnant very quickly. 
        Week 1 - At this early stage, there will usually be no signs. Towards the end of Week 1, some dogs may have slight nausea that causes a decreased appetite. 
        Weeks 2 and 3 - Signs will begin to emerge. Some will be minimal, causing you to question if there are truly changes: She may be more tired than usual Her stomach may seem slightly swollen She may clean herself much more than normal Her nipples on her tummy seem larger than before During Week 2 there may still be some 'morning sickness' that causes nausea. This is often fleeting and a stronger, more heartier appetite will emerge as she transitions into Week 3 Week 4 
        Week 3 and 4 - Signs are now very clear: The Pug's stomach will be distended, clearly showing that she is carrying a litter Her nipples will be enlarged and darkened as her body prepares for nursing; some that were previously flush with the skin will now be popped out. For those that have had been bred before, nipples may hang down as they fill with colostrum She will have strong nesting tendencies, wanting to prepare for the impending birth. Her appetite will have increased greatly. Pregnant dogs often eat up to twice as much as normal at this point.
        Weeks 5 and 6: Nearing the end of the gestation period, a Pug may shows the following signs: She may tired out very easily now The Pug often wants to remain at home and will usually be less social. It is normal for her to retreat to a quite spot to rest There will be a final weight gain of approximately 10% of her normal body weight; this will vary depending on the litter size. This will be comprised of not just the pups (each will be under one pound, weighing only mere ounces) but also will fluids (water, amniotic fluids) and tissue (amniotic sacs that surround each fetus).</p>
