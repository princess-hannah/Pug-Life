      <p>When it comes to feeding your beloved pug there is no one size fits all solution. Every dog is different. Age, supplements, activity, illness, and veterinary recommendations are all factors that influence what the “best” dog food (or foods) will be. Be sure to keep in mind the fact that every pug is different. Some may need to have their food portioned (according to weight, activity, and size) and supplemented, while others may be content on a free feed diet. Some may like to have their food alternated monthly, while others may eat the same brand of food from weaning to death.</p>

<p>-Age: Puppies will need a different kind of dog food than their adult counterparts. Deemed “puppy food’ or “puppy chow,” this food is supposed to contain nutrients essential to your puppy pug’s growth. Unfortunately, some brands use fillers, or grain, to lower the cost of their food. Be sure to read the listed ingredients before making a purchase. Additionally, make sure the food will not present a choking hazard to your pug. Some brands to check into are: Ziwipeak, Holistic Selects, Orijen, Venison formula, and Blue Buffalo. Alternatively, you can make (or buy) frozen raw dog food. Be sure you portion your puppy’s food just right as he or she grows.</p>

<p>Pug Puppy Recommendation: Blue Buffalo Pug Dog Food for Small Breed Puppies. A wise man once said that “It’s better to build strong children, then repair broken men.” And I believe that concept applies to dogs as well. When Benji was a puppy, we wanted the absolute best to help him grow and Blue Buffalo was consistently recommended among not only pug owners, but across all breeds as a good solid dog food at an affordable price. If you’re considering another option, be sure to look for dog food specially formulated for small breed puppies.</p>
